```R
library(devtools)
install_github("OHDSI/OhdsiStudy2")
library(OhdsiStudy2)
?execute # To get extended help

execute(dbms = "postgresql",
        user = "joebruin",
        password = "supersecret",
        server = "myserver",
        cdmSchema = "cdm_schema",
        resultsSchema = "results_schema")
